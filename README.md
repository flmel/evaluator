NEAR EVALUATOR - WIP
==================
WORK IN PROGRESS

This project aims to create a self-paced course, in which each step presents a new concept to the student, and then test the learned knowledge in a decentralized way. Once all steps are completed, the course can issue a non-transferable NFT certificate for the student.

This can expand/add to previous educational efforts such as [NEAR ACADEMY](https://near.academy/) and NCD by NF Edu Team


Smart Contract
==
The contract can evaluate other contracts. This works by making cross contract calls, in which we first pass data to the contract to be evaluated, and then we call the smart contract to see if it returns the right data.


Front-End
==
TBD: BOS widgets, stand alone app or something in between
