# Hello NEAR Contract

The smart contract exposes two methods to enable storing and retrieving a greeting in the NEAR network.

```ts
@NearBindgen({})
class HelloNear {
  greeting: string = "Hello";

  @view // This method is read-only and can be called for free
  get_greeting(): string {
    return this.greeting;
  }

  @call // This method changes the state, for which it cost gas
  set_greeting({ greeting }: { greeting: string }): void {
    // Record a log permanently to the blockchain!
    near.log(`Saving greeting ${greeting}`);
    this.greeting = greeting;
  }
}
```
