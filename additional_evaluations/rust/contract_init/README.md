# Initialize a Hello NEAR Contract

This test builds on top of the standard `hello near` example contract. We are required to write a init function called `new` that takes a string as an argument and initializes the contract's state.

# Quickstart

1. If you don't have rust already installed check out the [NEAR docs](https://docs.near.org/sdk/rust/get-started)
2. Use `yarn --cwd sandbox-ts` to install dependencies
3. Use `./test.sh` script to run the tests
